# Maths-Project
My school project on Maths about making a computer program that includes operations with functions

## How to run the file
- Just running matematik.py in matematik-proje folder with photos in the same directory
- Copy the dist folder in matematik-proje folder and run class.exe file (again with photos in the same directory, copying the dist folder is recommended)
